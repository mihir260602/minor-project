		About Biochemistry
    </h1>
    <div>
        Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. A sub-discipline of both chemistry and biology, divided into three fields: 
        <ul type="circle"><li>structural biology</li><li>enzymology</li><li>metabolism</li>
        </ul>
        It is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at the cellular and molecular level. It emerged as a distinct discipline around the beginning of the 20th century when scientists combined chemistry, physiology, and biology to investigate the chemistry of living systems.
        Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, bonding, functions, and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.They provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life.The chemistry of the cell also depends upon the reactions of small molecules and ions. These can be inorganic (for example, water and metal ions) or organic (for example, the amino acids, which are used to synthesize proteins).The mechanisms used by cells to harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases.Nutrition studies how to maintain health and wellness and also the effects of nutritional deficiencies.In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers. Improving crop cultivation, crop storage, and pest control are also goals. Biochemistry is extremely important since it helps individuals learn about complicated topics such as prions.

        Biochemistry Career Scope
    </h2>
    <div>
        Once you successfully obtain a degree in this field, you can easily find a plethora of employment opportunities as per your degree level. Usually, after a masterâ€™s degree, students can work majorly in sectors like Medicine, Agriculture, and Nutrition. Majorly, the role in the aforementioned sectors revolves around studying the cause of various diseases whilst analyzing the effect of chemicals on the human body. Along with this, measuring the impact of different nutrients in the human diet is also what you will be required to do.
